Here are the sketches for my previous version of hardware that led to the present ttc_check firmware.

TTC_display - Used to test my code to drive the the seven segment display, namely ESP32 timers.
              It was previously directly driven from the ESP32 rather than a shift register, which
              limited the current we could provide the LEDs.

TTCrequestor was my series of sketches that actually got the predictions using the ESP32. Going by 
version, highlighting the main changes:

V1 - Heavily based on the TinyXML's example for NextBus. Collected predictions and provided them 
     over serial. Did not have any display related code, focused solely on data collection.
     
V2 - Incorperated code to directly drive the seven-segment displays from the ESP32 and show the values.

V3 - Improved the implementation of my debugging features, namely using #ifdef ... #endif to include 
     debugging code in the compiled binary if "DEBUG_MODE" was defined or not, instead of using "if" 
     structures. Saves compile time and flash when not debugging.
     
V4 - Removed the use of TinyXML, using my own basic parsing function instead to get times.
